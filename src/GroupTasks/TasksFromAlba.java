    Q11: Sort Ascending
Write a return method that can sort an int array in Ascending order without using the sort method of the Arrays class

Ex:
       int[] arr = {10, 9, 8, 7};
       arr = Sort(arr);  ==>   { 7, 8, 9, 10};


Q12: Sort Descending
Write a return method that can sort an int array in descending order without using the sort method of the Arrays class

Ex:
     int[] arr = {10,20,7, 8, 90};
     arr = Sort(arr);  ==>  {90, 20, 10, 8, 7};


Q13: N unique integers that sum up to 0
Write a function that: given an integer N (1 < N < 100), returns an array containing N unique integers that sum up to 0. The function can return any such array. For example, given N = 4, the function could return [1,0, -3,2] or [-2,1, -4,5]. The answer [1, -1,1,3] would be incorrect (because value 1 occurs twice). For N = 3 one of the possible answers is [-1,0,1]  (but there are many more correct answers).

Q14: Permutation combinations
Given an array of 3 characters print all permutation combinations from the given characters

Q15: Move zeros to the end
Write a method that can move all the zeros to  last indexes of the array (Do Not Use Sort Method)
